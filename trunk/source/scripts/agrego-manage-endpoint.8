\fBadd\fR \fIagrego_instance_name\fR
will add a new Agrego instance, so it will create the directory
/etc/agrego-@@ENDPOINT@@/agrego_instance_name/ and fill it with 3 files
(start.sh, stop.sh and agrego.ini). And also create the daemon script,
/etc/init.d/agrego-@@ENDPOINT@@-agrego_instance_name. All this files come from
/usr/share/agrego-@@ENDPOINT@@/.

After the script will ask you if you want to
launch the daemon at boot. If \fB-f\fR is specified this question is not asked
and the daemon will be launched at next reboot.
